# Importance of free time

For my storytelling I choose a topic about free time. Especially my free time and its importance.

### Why is free time important to me?
It is very important to have your free time outside of work. because if we just worked, we'd probably go crazy.
So it is very good for our mental health.
Everyone's way of relax is different. someone likes to run, swim, read, paint...

### What I do in the free time?
Of course, I also really like to just lie on the couch and watch TV or read. And that is also very necessary. But after a day of looking at the computer, I rather like to spend time in nature, with friends or sports.
So my top 3 activities are: Dance, dogs, time with friends.

I've been doing majorette since I was 8 years old, so it's a big part of my life.
It is a aesthetic sport in which we work with tools (baton, pompon), but dancing skills are also important.
I am also in the role of a coach and train a few little girls. I love working with children, so this is very motivating.

I like to spent time in nature with my dogs. My friend and I go for walks together.
We live in a village, so we mainly go to the woods, to the fields or to the water
it is very relaxing especially after i arrive from noisy Prague.

Time with friends
It is very important to spend time with friends. Laugh, get a little distracted from work, school...
I have a friends group with people from my village and we like to go camping together, go on trips, play games ...
And I am very grateful for that!
