# ABOUT ME

Hi, my name is Michaela Polášková. I'm a graphic designer, currently working in Konektime. I make graphics for their film platform called České kino.
(check it out: <www.ceskekino.cz>)

I have liked to paint since I was little girl and I wanted to be a painter. Luckily, I changed my mind, and I chose graphic design. But I still love illustration.

I studied graphic design in high school and am now at University of Creative Communication (VŠKK). I'm graduating this year (2023), and I hope in the next year to find a job that I will love.
