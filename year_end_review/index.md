## Year and Review

### 1. What did you like most about this course?
Definitely humane and friendly approach. 

### 2. What did you like least about this course?
3 hours is sometimes too much for a concentration. 

### 3. What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

- Work in github
- To present in front of people
- Trust yourself more (Thanks to your positive and friendly attitude)

### 4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment?
Presentations by others on the topic of storytelling. It was fun and interesting.

### 5. What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?
My storytelling. I don't like to talk about myself in front of a lot of people so this was stepping out of my comfort zone.

### 6. What’s one thing you learned about yourself?
I need more confidence.

### 7. What’s one thing you could have done better?
I could talk more in class and be more active.

### 8. What’s one thing I could have done better?
Nothing!

### 9. What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?
Maybe give some time in class to work on projects. We don't have much time outside of school. And if so, we have to devote it to bachelor's theses.

### 10. What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
Just don't stress and enjoy the freedom that Justin gives you during your creation!
