# ČESKÉ KINO (CZECH CINEMA)

In november i started working in a company called Konektime. They were starting a new project. It is a streaming service focused on Czech films.
It works from the beginning of December 2022.

My work is posts on social networks, posters and banners for websites. The graphic designer who created the logo and the entire visual prepared the materials for me.
So I have a pattern that I follow. It's easy.

## Social sites

when I make posts to the social media, I take a screenshot of the movie first. I have to find an interesting moment.
Then I add filters and the necessary things to it.

## Final
It is a long-term cooperation. I enjoy it and it's not difficult. It takes me about 30 hours a month and I work from home. I hope to stay here until the end of college.
