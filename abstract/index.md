## Abstract

The topic of this bachelor thesis is the creation of a new visual style for the music festival Hrady CZ. It is a festival that takes place every summer weekend at a different castle in the Czech Republic. The goal of the work is to create a design that will be more attractive to the audience and will be more suitable for the target group, and also to increase the number of visitors to Czech cultural monuments with the help of the festival, even outside the festival season.
The theoretical part is mainly devoted to festivals, visual style and marketing communication. It also pays attention to the issue of attendance at Czech castles.
The practical part consists of questionnaire, determining the target group or creating a mood board. It also deals with the Hrady CZ festival, its current visual style and the design of a new identity.
