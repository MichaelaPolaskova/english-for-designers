## Final thesis

For my final thesis I choose Visual style of a festival.


### Why?
I chose the visual style of the festival because it is playful and friendly topic and I was interested in the theme.
I was thinking about which festival to choose and I found the Hrady CZ, which I think deserves a new design.

### What is HRADY CZ?

It is a summer cultural festival that takes place every weekend at a different castle in the Czech Republic.
The ticket price also includes entrance to the castle. This increases the number of visitors to the castles.
There are 8 places all over the Czech Republic.

Here is how might look like. It is a stage with view of the castle.

### My target group:
18 - 35 years old

### My target:
Create a unified visual style.
Increase the number of visitors to Czech castles even outside the festival season.


## My design

### Colors

This is a summer festival, so I chose a warm color that is typical for summer, but at the same time has a respect for the culture, which I tried to preserve in the entire visual style.

### Logo

When creating the logo, I tried to connect culture with music and show the uniqueness and exceptionality of the chosen festival.
The first line of letter is tower with battlement. The rest of the letter is plus. The plus is like "something more".

### Instagram competition
To increase the number of visitors to castles in the Czech Republic,
I would create a competition on Instagram for the most beautiful photo of the castle. The competi- tion would run from January to the end of April, and the winner would receive two tickets to Hrady CZ.

### Mobile application

One of the main actions in the application is collecting "pluses" at castles in the Czech Republic outside the summer festival season. This will increase their traffic over the year. The event would take place from September to June.
All monuments would have a QR code at the reception, which the visitor would read into the application. For each loaded castle in the Czech Republic, he gets one plus. You can get various vouchers for a plus.

### Merch

As the festival takes place in the open air, the visitor must be prepared for any weather. That's why I designed hats in two color variants that protect visitors from the sun, but also umbrellas that protect them from the rain.

I also designed packaging for "you + me" condoms, which serve more for entertainment, but also as a funny souvenir that visitors can bring home to their partners.
