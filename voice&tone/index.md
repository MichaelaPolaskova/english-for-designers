# VOICE&TONE&STYLE


## Voice

I thing is necessery be friendly and nice but at the same time professional. And I try to sound confident.

So this is my three important points:

1. Friendly
2. Professional
3. Confident

## Tone

1. Respektfull
2. Kind of funny
4. Informal and friendly, but still a bit professional

## STYLE

1. use emoticons - my favorit = :)
2. Write the way I normally speak. 
3. Write sentences short and clear, but not too short.
4. make paragraphs. For easy orientation.
