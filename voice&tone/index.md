# VOICE & TONE & STYLE


## Voice

I thing is necessary be friendly and nice but at the same time professional. And I try to sound confident.

So this are my three important points:

1. Friendly
2. Professional
3. Confident

## Tone

1. Respectfull
2. Kind of funny
4. Informal and friendly, but still a bit professional

## Style

1. use emoticons - my favorit = :)
2. Write the way I normally speak
3. Write sentences short and clear, but not too short
4. Make paragraphs for easy orientation
